# Tweet-Sentiment-Analysis-and-Wordcloud

#### I started out following a tweet sentiment analysis tutorial (NeuralNine), but I also wanted to visualize the tweets and that's where WordCloud comes in. 

#### It doesn't generate the words based on frequency, that is something I'd like to do in the future but for now I am fine with the output. 

#### I also took advantage of the masking feature but have been finding it difficult to find pictures that work. Currently only the alice file given in WordClouds documentation has been working for me, so I did not add the code for that.
